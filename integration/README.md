Run credit concurrency tests against a disposable **local** PostgreSQL database named
`credit_test`. Never supply a production URL. The test config refuses remote hosts
and other database names; it uses the real Prisma client rather than the unit-test fake.

```sh
export CREDIT_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:55987/credit_test
DATABASE_URL="$CREDIT_TEST_DATABASE_URL" DIRECT_URL="$CREDIT_TEST_DATABASE_URL" npx prisma db push --skip-generate
npm run test:postgres
```

Use a fresh database with the current Prisma schema. Tests create unique shops,
customers, users and products, then delete only their own fixtures. Both request paths
run concurrently while a third transaction holds the customer row lock. Tests wait
for two blocked PostgreSQL backends before releasing the lock, and verify balances
against the signed ledger plus sale/stock rollback. No production services are called.

For the two-sale case only, a Prisma middleware allocates distinct receipt counts.
This prevents the unrelated receipt unique constraint and retry loop from serializing
the test accidentally. Everything involved in the credit invariant uses real Postgres.
The suite was also run against the pre-fix sale and controller implementations:
all four limit-race tests failed; override and unlimited cases passed.
